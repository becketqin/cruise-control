/**
 * A class that helps select metric values for linear regression.
 *
 * Ideally we should have same number of witnessed values in each of the buckets, i.e. uniform distribution.
 * In reality, it is unlikely that the raw witnessed values will distribute evenly. So we need discard some
 * of the values if the buckets those value belongs to already have enough observations.
 *
 * We define the sufficiency of observations as the following. Given N buckets sorted by the number of values in them in
 * descending order. Users can define a number M where M < N. Assume the M(th) bucket in the above sorted bucket
 * list has X values, if a bucket has more than X values it is considered to have enough observations, and any
 * further values to that bucket should not be included into the linear regression model to avoid one bucket
 * dominating the linear regression result.
